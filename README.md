# Telescope_Simulator
 A python script for not just simulating the field of view but also atmospheric seeing and diffraction effects.

Above is an example of the simulation in action. Left is the input, a image of Jupiter taken by the Hubble space telescope. Right is the output of the simulation, the image of Jupiter as would be seen by a 8" telescope with a focal length of 1.2 meters, using a 3x barlow lens and a CCD with 2 micron sized pixels. Not only does this script resample the image, it also simulates the effects of diffraction limited resolution and perturbations due to atmospheric seeing.
